Monday: Just in memory for now.
* DONE Create a uniqueue datastructure, no concept of ids 
* DONE Create protocol <PUT, GET>
* DONE Hook them up 
** DONE main with mina setup
** DONE create handler
** DONE create something to manage multiple queues (handler? No, create another object)
* Support callbacks
** add CPUT -> CPUT qname callback_url\n data
** now need to support a more convoluted workflow
   as the call back will be called when a job completes
   Going with a beanstalkdish workflow:
       get means a client is reserving a job
           get returns: <id> <ttr>\ndata\r\n.\r\n
       done <id> means a jobs is done
       touch <id> means a client needs more time to work on a job.
           resets the ttr timer on the job
   queue will put jobs that havent finished by the given ttr back on
   to the available jobs queue.
